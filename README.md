## Campaign Spending Open Challenge

Our team created this web app to submit for the 2016 Hawaii Annual Code
Challenge.

## Challenge Problem

The Campaign Spending Commission provides a tremendous amount of Candidate
Contribution and Expenditure data available through
[data.hawaii.gov](https://data.hawaii.gov/).  We identify the “area, scope, or
jurisdiction” of contributors so that voters can see how much a particular
industry contributed to candidates.  It would be very interesting, for example,
to see how much the construction industry contributed to each of the mayoral
candidates and over a specific period of time.

It is one thing to see who contributed to a particular candidate, how often
they contributed, and how much they contributed.  That data is accessible in
[data.hawaii.gov](https://data.hawaii.gov/) and using the tools Socrata makes
available one can filter, group, and total records fairly easily.

We enable grouping by industry sector to allow reporting based on "special
interests".  For example, knowing how much energy companies contributed to a
candidate might give us an idea of where that candidate would stand on an
alternative energy proposal.
